[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org)-based web component progress indicator. Loading quickly at first, then slower and slower until you tell it things are loaded.

## Installation

To install from NPM:
```shell
npm install @brightspace-ui/page-load-progress
```

## Usage

```html
<head>script>
  <script type="module" src="node_modules/@brightspace-ui/page-load-progress/d2l-page-load-progress.js"></script>
</head>
```

The custom element `<d2l-labs-page-load-progress>` can now be used in your page. The best place for it is usually at the very top:

```html
<d2l-labs-page-load-progress autostart color="#003b71"></d2l-labs-page-load-progress>
<button onclick="document.querySelector('d2l-labs-page-load-progress').start();">Start</button>
<button onclick="document.querySelector('d2l-labs-page-load-progress').finish();">Finish</button>
<main>
  Main page content here.
</main>
```

### Starting & Finishing

Progress can be started, restarted and finished using its JavaScript API's `start()` and `finish()` methods. Make sure you wait for the `WebComponentsReady` event before interacting with it.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', function() {

  var progress = document.getElementById('myProgress');
  progress.start();

  // take 2 seconds to "load"
  setTimeout(function() {
    progress.finish();
  }, 2000);

});
```

To start **automatically**, set the `autostart` attribute:

```html
<d2l-labs-page-load-progress autostart></d2l-labs-page-load-progress>
```

### Color

By default, the progress bar will be grayscale. However, the color can be customized using the `color` attribute:

```html
<d2l-labs-page-load-progress color="#d81b60"></d2l-labs-page-load-progress>
```

### Auto-hide

The `autohide` property will set `display: hidden` on the progress bar when `finish` is called:

```html
<d2l-labs-page-load-progress autohide></d2l-labs-page-load-progress>
```

## Versioning & Releasing

> TL;DR: Commits prefixed with `fix:` and `feat:` will trigger patch and minor releases when merged to `master`. Read on for more details...

The [sematic-release GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/master/semantic-release) is called from the `release.yml` GitHub Action workflow to handle version changes and releasing.

### Version Changes

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules:
1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

The next version number will be determined from the commit messages since the previous release. Our semantic-release configuration uses the [Angular convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular) when analyzing commits:
* Commits which are prefixed with `fix:` or `perf:` will trigger a `patch` release. Example: `fix: validate input before using`
* Commits which are prefixed with `feat:` will trigger a `minor` release. Example: `feat: add toggle() method`
* To trigger a MAJOR release, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines in the footer of the commit message
* Other suggested prefixes which will **NOT** trigger a release: `build:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:` and `test:`. Example: `docs: adding README for new component`

To revert a change, add the `revert:` prefix to the original commit message. This will cause the reverted change to be omitted from the release notes. Example: `revert: fix: validate input before using`.

### Releases

When a release is triggered, it will:
* Update the version in `package.json`
* Tag the commit
* Create a GitHub release (including release notes)
* Deploy a new package to NPM

### Releasing from Maintenance Branches

Occasionally you'll want to backport a feature or bug fix to an older release. `semantic-release` refers to these as [maintenance branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/workflow-configuration#maintenance-branches).

Maintenance branch names should be of the form: `+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x`.

Regular expressions are complicated, but this essentially means branch names should look like:
* `1.15.x` for patch releases on top of the `1.15` release (after version `1.16` exists)
* `2.x` for feature releases on top of the `2` release (after version `3` exists)
